# loft API prototype

## Purpose

This is a crude test for using Haskell for an API to serve Labor and Cost Forecast data to a Flutter (/any) UI.

## Caveat

It might work.  You'll need the B56 Haskell repo, this prototype uses it for IDs, but it's not otherwise necessary.

## Use
Build with cabal and play around.  It's just a simple prototype, don't overthink it.
